# 🥷 Ninja Warriors

A school project – a 2D game built with the **MonoGame** framework where you play as a ninja collecting coins while avoiding enemies such as zombies and skeletons.  
The goal is to survive as long as possible and gather as many points as you can!

###Notes 
Use 
**left-ctrl** to lower the volume and **left-alt** to raise the volume. Only works in the gamescene, not the menu.

There is a lot of comments in the code from the initial tutorial from MonoGame, other comments are there for learning-purposes.
